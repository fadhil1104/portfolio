# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, originally downloaded as a template from [HTML Codex](https://htmlcodex.com/). I have made significant modifications to the template, including backend integration and enhancements to fit my specific needs.

## Features and Modifications

### 1. **Template Customization**
- The template from HTML Codex was customized to better align with my personal preferences.
- Changes include design adjustments, layout tweaks, and customization of text and images to match my professional portfolio needs.

### 2. **Backend Integration**
- Integrated a backend system to handle form submissions.
- Used **Google Sheets** as a lightweight database to store data submitted through the contact form.
  
### 3. **Google Sheets Integration**
- The contact form on the website is connected to Google Sheets.
- Form submissions are automatically saved to a Google Sheet, allowing for easy data collection and management without a full-scale backend setup.
